# Minerva Documentation (Volunteer accounts)
- Minerva is a site that allows for food banks to do easy route management. As a volunteer, you'll be able to see the fastest route, view Google Maps links, and keep track of which houses you've delivered at.

## Creating an account
- You can create a new account at https://minervagroceries.org/volunteerregister 
- When you've been approved, you'll be able to access your dashboard.
- Whenever it's your shift, hit the button on your dashboard to claim a new route. 

### Tools you get
- You can hit the link to see your route on Google Maps. Google doesn't allow navigation for routes with a large amount of stops, so you might not be able to rely off of this link.
- The order that each client's card is displayed is also the order that you should deliver in. Each card has a Google Maps link on it, and that's an easy way to get good navigation.
- You can also click "generate driver printout." This contains both a list, in order, of who you should deliver to, as well as QR codes to Google Maps.
- Whenever you complete a delivery, it is important to mark each client as complete. This will ensure that people who are waiting longer for deliveries get their food on time.
